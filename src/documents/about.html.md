Hi. I'm Joe.

I live in a small house in rainy Portland, Oregon with my lovely wife Bev and our son Zeke.

I write front-end JavaScript for [Janrain](http://janrain.com/).

Like any good Portlander, I enjoy drinking good coffee, eating good food, and riding my bicycle to work.

In my free time I try to read, write (both prose and code), and climb rocks whenever I can.

### bio

I was born in Seoul, S. Korea, but immigrated to the US at two months old.

In September of 2002, I enlisted in the US Marine Corps Infantry. I served two tours in Iraq, and one in the West Pacific.

After that, I used the GI Bill to earn my B.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of Washington in Seattle.

### about this site

I built this site with [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap). It runs on [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com/) in a [Docker](http://docker.io/) container.
