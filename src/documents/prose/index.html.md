### technology

I write about various (mostly nerdy) things on my [blog](/blog).

I've also somehow managed to get a few pieces published on [The Atlantic's Technology Channel](http://www.theatlantic.com/joe-moon/).

### homework

As a Comparative Literature major, I did a lot of writing. Here's some of it:

* *Problems in the Publication of In-Flight Magazines* &mdash; [January 2009](/prose/magazines) <br />
  Reflective essay on internship experience at a small publishing company.
* *A Hospital Visit* &mdash; [June 2008](/prose/hospital) <br />
  Final paper for a Narrative Journalism course, winner of the Deb Kaplan Narrative Journalism Award 2008 for "Story that Illuminates an Important Public Issue."
* *Achilles' Armor and Identity in The Iliad* &mdash; [March 2008](/prose/achilles) <br />
  Final paper for an Epic Tradition course.
* *Concrete and Abstract Adaptation in* Adaptation &mdash; [September 2007](/prose/adaptation) <br />
  Critical essay on the film *Adaptation* ([2002](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/)).

### war

I kept a blog during most of my enlistment as a U.S. Marine Corps infantryman.
  
I collected posts from my second deployment [here](http://servicerecordbook.com).

The final entry was published in the University of Washington Comparative History of Ideas Department Publication The Anthology Project ([June 2007](href="https://depts.washington.edu/chid/The_Anthology_Project/2007/")).
