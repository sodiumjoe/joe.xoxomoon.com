I've been writing code for at least several weeks now. I have an opinion about punctuation in JavaScript.

[This](https://github.com/joebadmo/dotfiles) is my dotfiles repo. There are many like it but this one is mine.

I generally work in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) in a [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) session running in [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) in [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) on a Mac.
